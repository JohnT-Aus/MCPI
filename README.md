Message Centre Planner Integration with automation using a SharePoint List and Power Automate

Please ensure to use the Service Account during the whole process outlined below and for the import and any subsequent tweaks to the Flow. 
1. All performed as the Service Account (unless a suitable Team already exists). 
2. Create a centralised Microsoft Teams Team that contains all relevant stakeholders. 
3. Create the Planner Board and configure as outlined with all the labels and 
bucket/s required within the Team created (or used) above. 
4. Create a SharePoint List in the same Teams group (IE â€“MCPIAutomationVariables) 
and add the list elements for the variables needed as future reference within the Flow, 
outlined below. 
5. Import or create a Power Automate Flow that is triggered when a new Planner task is created. 
6. Customise the Flow to reflect the three (3) actions that need some initial configuration. 
7. Connect to https://admin.microsoft.com as the Service Account and navigate to the 
Message Centre area under Health. 
8. Then, configure the sync of the Microsoft 365 Message Centre posts to the Planner 
board including regular update frequency.

The SharePoint List is needed for the Variables to be used within the Power Automate Automation and should reflect the Excel CSV included.
